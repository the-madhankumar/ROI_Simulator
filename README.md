Here’s a polished **README** template for your ROI Simulator project. I’ll include placeholders for screenshots which you can replace with actual images.

# ROI Simulator

A web-based ROI (Return on Investment) simulator that calculates the financial impact of automating manual processes. Users can input parameters such as invoice volume, staff, hourly wage, error rates, and implementation costs to see monthly savings, ROI, and payback period.

## Features

* Input scenario parameters such as monthly invoice volume, number of staff, hourly wage, error rate, and implementation cost.
* Store each scenario in the database for future reference.
* Simulate ROI and financial metrics for automation vs. manual processes.
* Display results instantly in a clean, user-friendly interface.
* Supports multiple scenarios.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (Class Components)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Database:** SQLite
* **Styling:** CSS (Flexbox layout)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js installed

I can also create a **ready-to-use markdown with placeholders replaced by actual base64 images** so you don’t have to manually link screenshots.

Do you want me to do that next?
